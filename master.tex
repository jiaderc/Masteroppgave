An important ability for every mobile robots is being able to identify different terrains. Past works has been studied on variety of sensors and achieved a promising result. However, a type of optical tactile sensor, which use optoelectronic components to measure the contact force has paid a little attention. Due to high sensitivity, small size, light weight and low detection time, this thesis will be investigating the possibility of using the sensor mounted on quadruped robot to identify different terrains. This thesis will also present a novel algorithm to segment interesting data from the sensor. These data consists of steps on different terrains, and is used as training and test samples. Five different feature sets were created from the data samples, and tested on five different classifiers. The highest accuracy achieved to classify four different terrains is 95.2\%, by using the SVM. Evaluation shows that the suggested optical tactile sensor is able to discriminate nearly identical terrains, and is good candidate to use on terrain classification.

Humans naturally adapt their walking style on different terrain to have a stable locomotion to prevent falls. Adaption of the walking style comes from past experiences. For instance, one might experienced difficulty of running on icy road, resulting in a fall, while running on dry road will be fine. To achieve this ability, the robot must be able to detect and distinguish different terrains.
\\
\\ 
New and improved sensors have made it possible to distinguish terrain even more accurately. Examples of popular sensors used to gather information visually from terrain are camera \cite{littleDog} and laser scanners \cite{4651026}. These types of sensors gather information from terrain indirectly. Other sensors measure the properties of the terrain more directly such as tactile, joint angle, accelerometers and gyroscopes. Degrave et al.\cite{6784609} investigated different types and combinations of sensors for a quadruped robot to identify which of them is suitable, and provide most information on the terrain. The result showed that the most informative sensors were a combination of tactile sensors and proprioceptive joint angle sensors. A type of tactile sensor, 3-axis optical force sensor, use refracted light intensity to measure the contact force has not been used much within terrain classification. Due to high sensitivity, small size, light weight and low detection time \cite{Dutta2016}, the sensor is suitable to obtain information from terrain. The goal of this thesis is to use 3-axis optical force sensor and investigate whether it can distinguish terrains with slight differences such as floor and carpet.
\\
\\
This thesis will also be investigating on how to preprocess data, create and select features and test on several learning algorithms to find a reliable approach.

\section{Terrain classification}
Terrain classification is the process of identifying different types of terrain by looking at characteristics such as texture, slope, roughness, hardness, and friction. For instance grass is soft and provide an amount of friction, while rocks is hard and might have less friction than grass. Outdoor terrains is more unpredictable due to its unstructured environment, and their properties change accordingly to the weather. For instance rain will soften the soil and snow will make the road slippery. Indoor on other hand, is more predictable, since it has more structured environment and the terrain will not be highly affected of the same factors.

\section{Legged robots}
The following paragraphs will introduce several platform of different legged robots.

\paragraph{Monopod}
The monopod is a simple one legged robot design. The locomotion of the monopod robots is performed through hops, and it is also called "hopping robots". Having only a single point of ground contact, the challenge is achieving stability. An example of one legged robot is developed by Marc Raibert, shown in figure \ref{fig:onlegg} \cite{Raibert:1986:LR:5948.5950}.

\paragraph{Biped}
A biped is a robot with two legs. The studies on biped robots have been a popular research field, especially towards developing humanoids. Creating a humanoid implicates that the robot is able to imitate humans behavior, such as walking, running, jumping, traversing on stairs etc. The well-kown NAO robot \cite{NAO}, shown in figure \ref{fig:nao} has impressive abilities. Not only is NAO robot able to walk, but it is also capable of see, hear and speak. 

\paragraph{Quadruped}
The quadruped is robot designed with four legs and is inspired from animals. The BigDog \cite{Raibert200810822} shown in figure \ref{fig:bigDog} has shown impressive performance. Hydraulic actuators make the BigDog stronger and is able to carry load from 50kg to 150kg, depending on the terrain. Other abilities includes being able to jump, run, and maintain the stability even it get pushed or walking on slippery terrain. More legs makes robots more stable, and is capable to traverse through terrain without falling. However it is more complex to control the legs.

\paragraph{Hexapod}
A hexapod is six legged robot, and is inspired by insects, mostly spiders. By having more legs provides a more stable walking system. However, the leg coordination might be more complex, due to controlling six legs. An example of a hexapod developed from The FZI Research Center for Information Technology is the LAURON robot. Many versions of Lauron has been developed, and currently used is the Lauron V shown in figure \ref{fig:LAURON}.

\subsection{Gait}
Stable locomotion of legged robots is achieved through the gait. A gait is a cyclic motion of sequence of foot contacts with the ground that produce locomotion \cite{1641859}. A characteristic is by the sequence of which legs are lifted and placed on the ground. Different style of locomotion is produced by different gaits.


\section{Tactile sensor}
Tactile sensor are designed for measure properties through direct physical interaction \cite{Cutkosky2008}. The tactile sensing can be used with three different activity, manipulation, exploration and response. These activities is shown in figure \ref{fig:tactiles}. For manipulation it means that it is possible to control for instance the grip force on an object. The exploration has possibility of identify objects by assimilate information properties such as hardness, friction, and roughness from materials and surface. Response refer to detection and reaction to contacts from external agents, which could be sense if it was a gentle touch or impact.  There is many types tactile sensor, one of sensor modality looking on skin deformation and optical components to measure force.

\subsection{Optical tactile force sensor}

A type of optical force sensors use the refracted light intensity to measure the deformation of the silicon \cite{6027100}\cite{6907805}. Tar and Cserey \cite{6027100} developed a 3D optical compliant tactile force sensor by using optoelectronic components. The design of the sensor consists of a hollow compliant convex surface made of silicone rubber, three photodiodes and an infra LED based sensor.  If a force is applied to the silicone rubber, it will cause a deformation that change the amount of light to each of photodiodes, which will change their force vector accordingly. Using the optical method to measure has offered highly dynamic sensory range, low noise, and high speed operation.

\section {Machine learning}
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence where it can learn to adapt or predict from earlier dataset without being explicitly programmed to do so. Each dataset consists of an feature vector which belong to a specified class. The training process consists of analyzing each feature vector and producing an inferred function, which is used for comparing new and unseen dataset to a class. The learning algorithm can be separated into supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement and evolutionary learning \cite{Marsland:2009:MLA:1571643}. 
	
\paragraph{Supervised learning}
Supervised learning algorithms predict new data based on a labeled dataset. That is, the system in learning process known correct answers to each dataset, and will base the prediction on that. The learning process usually stops when the algorithm converge towards an acceptable level of performance.
	
\paragraph{Unsupervised learning}
Unsupervised learning algorithms make predictions from data points without label. The system has to organize the data on its own and make prediction based on that. A common method to organize the data is by clustering.
	
\paragraph{Reinforcement learning}
Reinforcement learning algorithms will choose an action to each dataset and it will receive a reward indicating how good the decision was. Based on rewards, the algorithms modifies its strategy in order to get the highest reward. 
	
\paragraph{Evolutionary learning}
Evolutionary learning use biological evolution such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection as a learning process. 
	
\subsection{Classifier} \label{sub:classifier}
The classifier is where the learning process occur, and produceS the inferred function. The following sections will introduce technical background of five classifiers; artifical neural network, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors and decision tree.
	
\subsubsection{Artificial neural networks}
Artificial neural networks (ANN) is inspired by neurons in the human brain, and is one of the most popular learning algorithms. It can be found in many different research fields, such as signal processing, image processing, natural language processing etc. A common representation of a neuron is the perceptron shown in figure \ref{fig:NN}. It consists a set of weighted inputs $w_i$, an adder which sums weighted inputs signals, and an activation function to decide whether it should fire for the current input $x_i$. By connecting many perceptrons, one will obtain a neural network. Note that neurons only dependent on its inputs and error. That is, a neuron will not be affected by other neurons performance. Each neuron gives a result based on its own weights and the input, adding them together, and comparing the result to its own threshold. The only thing neurons share is the input. 
\\
\\
The learning process of a perceptron in supervised learning is to be able to reproduce a particular pattern to a class, which consist of firing and non-firing neurons for a given input. If some of the neurons yield a wrong output, for instance a neuron did not fire when it should, then its weights will be adjusted to make it fire right the next time. There is a possible to add more layers to the neural network, which make it able to handle non linearly separable problems. This is also called multi-layer perceptron (MLP), or multi neural network.

	\caption{Figure showing a simple model of a single perceptron \cite{Marsland:2009:MLA:1571643}}
	\label{fig:NN}
\end{figure}
	
\paragraph{Multi-Layer Perceptron}
A multi-layer perceptron consists of two or more layers between the input and output. Those layers are also called hidden layers because its value cannot be changed directly, and it is only observed in the training set. The training process can be divided into forward algorithm and backward algorithm. The forward algorithm start first by calculating the activations of the first hidden layer. Those activations and the next set of weights will be used to calculate the activations for the next layer, which could either be a hidden layer or the output. The output will then be compared to a target to compute an error. The backwards algorithm will be using the error to adjust the weights between the output-layer and hidden-layer. The algorithm stops when it has reach the inputs and changed weights in the entire graph.

	\caption{Figure showing a multi-layer perceptron with 1 hidden layer \cite{MLP}. It is possible to increase the number of hidden layers and nodes to each layer}
	\label{fig:MLP}
\end{figure}
	
\subsubsection{Support vector machine}
Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was introduced by Vapnik and Chervonekis in 1963, while the standard used today is introduced by Cortes and Vapnik in 1995 \cite{Cortes1995}. In figure \ref{fig:SVM} is an instance of 2-class classification, SVM. The dotted line is the boundary for the two classes: circle and cross. To predict new set of data, it will check which side of the decision boundary it lies. If a dataset lies under the boundary line (dotted line) it will classify as cross, while circle if above. If the decision boundary was moved small amount, there is it has a high risk of misclassifying the dataset which lie close to it. This is why SVM will find the optimal separating hyperplane. It will classifies training data more correctly, and will also generalize better with new unseen data. To find the best decision boundary will be the maximizing the margin. It will be found by find the furthest hyperplane from a data point. If a dataset is non-linearly separable data, the SVM will transform the data into higher dimensional where the data is linearly separable to make the classification.

			two-class classification problem \cite{Cortes1995}. Each of features vector with values according to the x- and y-axis, represents as classes: circles and crosses. The dotted line is the decision boundary and tell where each class belongs to. The classes that are hatched indicate they lies on the straight line. }
		\label{fig:SVM}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	
\subsubsection{Naive bayes}
Naive Bayes algorithm is based on Bayesâ theorem with the assumption of independence between every pair of features, hence the name ânaiveâ. Bayes's theorem in machine learning is often used to find the probability that a data set A occur, based on the data set B. The bayes theorem can be formulated as \cite{Press:2007:NRE:1403886}:
\begin{equation}
P(A \vert B) = P(A)\frac{P(B \vert A)}{P(B)}
\label{eq:bayesNaivews2}
\end{equation}
The $P(A \vert B)$ is the probability of A given that B has occurred, while $P(A \vert B)$ is the probability of B given that A has occured. $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are unconditional probabilities. The prediction is by use the highest probability among the possible terrains. 
	
\begin{comment}
	
	
	Several research based the terrain classification on naive bayes which has given good result \cite{6225128, 5981563}. The bayes' theorem suit to mathematical express the terrain identification problem \cite{Giguere06environmentidentification,6225128}. This is mathematically simple and allow to evaluate unexpected mismatch between sample classes and the real environments. The terrain classification problem can be expressed as \cite{6225128}:
	
	\begin{equation}
	P(\theta_{l}\vert X)={p(X\vert \theta_{l})P(\theta_{l})\over p(X)}
	\label{eq:bayesNaivews}
	\end{equation}
	
	The $\theta_{l}$ represent the class, which would be the possible terrains the robot is expected to predict. The X represent the observations, which are information from different sensors, also called feature vector. On the formula the \ref{eq:bayesNaivews} $P(\theta_{l}\vert X)$ is the conditional probability distribution. $P(X\vert \theta_{l})$ is the likelihood that the terrain is has with these observations, and the $P(\theta_{l})$ is the priori distribution of the classes, and $p(x)$ is the
	distribution of the observation. Classification is done by selecting a class that maximizes the a posteriori probability $P(\theta_{l}\vert X)$ according to the Maximization of A Posteriori (MAP) decision rule
	
	\begin{equation}
	p(X\vert \theta_{l})P(\theta_{l})=\displaystyle\mathop{\max}_{j}\{p(X\vert \theta_{j})P(\theta_{j})\}
	\label{eq:decision}
	\end{equation}
	
	The CPDF for each class can be estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically. An accurate nonparametric density is hard to estimate, especially when the number of features is high. One of the most popular parametric probability density functions is the normal distribution, which only requires an estimate of the mean $M_l$ and covariance matrix $\sum_1$ for the class $\theta_l$
	
	\begin{equation}
	p(X\vert \theta_{l}) = {1\over (2\pi)^{N/2}\vert \Sigma_{l}\vert ^{1/2}} \times{exp}\{-{1\over 2}(X-M_{l})^{T}\Sigma_{l}^{-1}(X-M_{l})\} 
	\label{eq:bayesLast}
	\end{equation}
	\end{comment}
	
\subsubsection{K-nearest neighbors }
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is one of the simple classifiers presented by Cover and Hart \cite{1053964}. The classification process of new data consists of looking the k-nearest data points and classify the class which consist most classes. An example is shown \ref{fig:KNN}. All the blue squares and red triangles are the training data, while the green circle is to be classified. The straight and dashed circle illustrate which data set is taken account when k is set either 3 or 5. If k set to  3, the circle will be classified as triangle, since the tree nearest neighbor consist more triangles than squares. If k set to 5, then the circle will be classified as square.
	
\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/KNN.png}
		\caption{Figure showing an example of a KNN classification \cite{KnnClassification}. The green circle is to be classified to either blue square or red triangle. The straight circle is when k = 3, while the dashed circle is when k = 5.}
		\label{fig:KNN}
\end{figure}
	
The most common method to find the k-nearest datapoint is to calculate the Euclidean Distance. The euclidean distance can be expressed as \cite{Bao2004}:
	
	
\begin{equation}
	D(x,y)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_{i}-y_{i})^2}
	\label{eq:edistance}
\end{equation}
The x and y from equation \ref{eq:edistance} represent the actual and unseen class, and m is the number of features to each of classes in x and y. The algorithm will then count k classes with shortest distance to determine which class the unseen data belongs to. A weakness of using Euclidean distance function is that if one of the vector has a large range, then it will dominate other attributes. In order to avoid this issue, it is common to scale the feature, described in section \ref{subsec:scaling}
	
	
\subsubsection{Decision tree}
The decision tree is a non-parametric classifier presented by JR Quinlan \cite{Quinlan1986}. The process of the decision tree is constructing a tree consisting of nodes and edges using the dataset. Each of nodes represents a test on one features, and the edges represent an outcome of the test. Leaf nodes represent the outcome class. Predicting process is following a path from the root to a leaf node.
	
	
\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/decisionTree.PNG}
		\caption{Figure showing an example of a simple decision tree \cite{Quinlan1986}. This decision tree classify a day to be P or N based on outlook, humidity and windy.}
		\label{fig:decisiontree}
\end{figure}
	
	
\section{Features} \label{features}
An important part of achieving a good classification, is finding good features from sensor data. The features is what distinguish between classes and will be used as learning set. Thus, finding good features is crucial to achieve a accurate classifier.
	
\subsection{Curse of dimensionality}\label{curseDim}
The curse of dimensionality occurs when one include too many features to the input vector. When the dimensionality of features vector increase, the complexity of underlying pattern might increase and the performance of the classifier will be degrade. To prevent the curse of dimensionality one can add more samples to uncover the underlying pattern.
	
\subsection{Features extraction} \label{feature_extraction}
Feature extraction is the process to build a new set of features from the original set and use it as training set. Those extracted features should make it easy for a classifier to distinguish between the various classes. A common method is extracting statistical features.
	
\subsubsection{Statistical features} \label{sub:statical}
The following paragraphs will be explaining five commonly used statical features; mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis.
	
\paragraph{Mean}
The mean is generally referred to the average, and is defined as sum of the values divided by the number of values\cite{Press:2007:NRE:1403886}:
	
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{N-1}^{j=0}x_{j}
\label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}
	
	
\paragraph{Variance}
Variance describe the spread between numbers in a data set. The variance can be written as\cite{Press:2007:NRE:1403886}:
	
	\begin{equation}
	Var(x_0\dotsc X_{N-1})  = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{N-1}^{j=0}(x_{j}-\bar{x})^2
	\label{eq:variance}
	\end{equation}

\paragraph{Standard deviation}
Standard deviation is a measure of spread of a data set from its mean. High deviation indicate that the data points are further from the mean. This can be calculated by taking the square root from variance\cite{Press:2007:NRE:1403886}:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\sigma(x_0\dotsc X_{N-1})  = \sqrt{Var(x_0\dotsc X_{N-1})}
	\label{eq:std}
	\end{equation}
	
\paragraph{Skewness} 
Skewness describes asymmetry of a distribution. The formula is\cite{Press:2007:NRE:1403886}:
	\begin{equation}
	Skew(x_0\dotsc X_{N-1})  =  \frac{1}{N}\sum_{N-1}^{j=0}\left [ \frac{x_j-\bar{x}}{\sigma} \right ]^3
	\label{eq:skew}
	\end{equation}
	
The skewness can be either negative or positive depending on whether data points are skewed to the left or to the right. If data is skewed to the left indicate a negative skewness, while positive skewness is when the data is skewed to the right. An illustration of both positive and negative skewness is shown in figure \ref{fig:skew}.
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Figures/Skewness}
		\caption{Skewness \cite{Press:2007:NRE:1403886}}
		\label{fig:skew}
	\end{figure}
	
	\FloatBarrier
	
\paragraph{Kurtosis}
Kurtosis measure the peak and tails of a distribution relative to a normal distribution. Using kurtosis might help to understand general characteristics about the distribution of the data. The formula is\cite{Press:2007:NRE:1403886}:
	\begin{equation}
	Kurt(x_0\dotsc X_{N-1}) = \left \{ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{N-1}^{j=0}\left [ \frac{x_j-\bar{x}}{\sigma} \right ]^4 \right \}-3
	\label{eq:kurtosis}
	\end{equation}
	
A positive kurtosis of a distribution has a sharper peak and heavier tails relative to normal distribution. While a negative kurtosis has flatter peak and lighter tails relative to normal distribution. An illustration of both positive and negative kurtosis is shown in figure \ref{fig:kurtosis}

\subsection{Features selection}\label{selection}	
The process in feature selection is to select a subset of features from the original set. Selecting good features has benefit of increasing classifier performance, prevent the curse of dimensionality mentioned in section \ref{curseDim} and reducing storage requirements and training time. Note that a features can individually be completely useless, but relevant when used together with other features \cite{Guyon2006}. There are three types of feature selection algorithms: filter-, wrapper- and embedded methods as shown in figure \ref{fig:selection}. 
	
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Figures/FilterWrapperEmbedded.PNG}
		\caption{The figure showing the three approaches of feature selection \cite{Guyon2006}. (a) filter method (b) wrapper method and (c) embedded method.  The shades show the components used by the three methods.}
		\label{fig:selection}
	\end{figure}
	
	
\paragraph{Filter}
Filter feature selection is independent of any classifier. It uses statistical measures to assign each feature a score. Features will either be kept or removed based on the score. The filter methods are considered fast and effective, specially when the number of features is large and the number of available training examples comparatively small.  
	
	
\paragraph{Wrapper}
Wrapper feature selection will try different combination of the feature set, evaluate by a classifier and keep the feature set with best result.
	
	
\paragraph{Embedded}
Embedded feature selection perform feature selection as part of the learning procedure and are usually specific to given classifier.

\subsection{Features scaling}
\label{subsec:scaling}
To reduce bias effect cause by skewed distributions, it is common to standardization the feature vectors. By scaling each features, it that avoid features with big number dominate compared features with small numeric ranges. It particularly affect classifier which use distance between classifier such as KNN and SVM.  By standardized feature values the features will weights equally in their representation.
	
	
\section{Model validation}
Model validation relate to evaluate the performance of a classifier. 
	
\subsection{No free lunch theorem} \label{seq:nofree}
The well-known no free lunch theorem\cite{NOFREELUNCH} in machine learning states that there is no best classifier for every problem. That is, even if a model achieve great performance for one problem, might not hold for another problem. Thus, it is recommended to apply several classifier.
	
\subsection{Ovefitting and underfitting}
Overfitting and underfitting the data is a issue in machine learning which cause a poor performance of classification. Overfitting occurs if there are too many training data or if it has adapted to the noise within data set. While underfitting occurs if there are not enough training data and will not be able to generalize new data set. An example for each case is shown in figure \ref{fig:fitting}. The cross-validation estimate how accurately the classifier model will perform in practice, which might prevent overfitting or underfitting the data.

		\label{fig:fitting}	
	\end{figure}
	
	\FloatBarrier
	
\subsection{Cross-Validation}
Cross-validation is used to assess the quality of a model. The process of cross-validation is to first remove some of the data before the training begins. After the training, it will use the removed data to test the performance. The intention is to evaluate the classifier performance in more realistic scenario by predicting new and unseen data. The K-fold is a common cross-validation method.
	
\paragraph{K-fold}
The process of k-fold is to partitioned the data into k subset, where one subset is used for testing and the other are used for training. When the trained model has assessed the test set, a new subset is selected as test set. This process is repeated k times, that is when all subsets have been used as a test set. Setting k to the length of feature vectors is also know as leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). LOOCV only use one feature vector as test set, while the rest as training set shown in figure \ref{fig:kfold}. The advantages is that using as many training samples as possible.

	\subsection{Evaluating Classifiers}\label{subsec:evalclf}
	Evaluation of the performance to classifier can be done by calculate metrics based on correct or wrong output. For instance a two-class classifier with classes, "postive" and "negative" will have four different outcomes:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item True postive (TP) is correct prediction of class positive
		\item True negative (TN) is correct prediction of class negative
		\item False positive (FP) is wrong prediction of class positive
		\item False negative (FN) is wrong prediction of class positive
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Those four variables can be further used to calculate the precision, accuracy, recall and f-score.
	
	\paragraph{Precision}
	Precision gives the number of correct detected class members.
	\begin{equation}
	Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
	\label{eq:prec}
	\end{equation}
	
	\paragraph{Accuracy}
	Accuracy gives the ratio of correct prediction. 
	\begin{equation}
	Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
	\label{eq:acc}
	\end{equation}
	
	\paragraph{Recall}
	Recall gives the number of detected actual class members.
	
	\begin{equation}
	Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
	\label{eq:recall}
	\end{equation}
	
	\paragraph{F-score}
	F-score is a balanced measure of recall and precision 
	\begin{equation}
	\textit{F-score} = 2*\frac{Precision*Recall}{Precision + Recall}
	\label{eq:fscore}
	\end{equation}
	%\part{The project}                    %% ... or ??
	\FloatBarrier
The accuracy will tell the overall performance of the model. However, there is a possibility that the model only classify three of four terrains correctly and still get a high accuracy. Thus, it will be recommended to look at the f-score. A low f-score indicate that the class either has a low precision, recall or both. Low precision indicate that the classifier has difficulty to predict the currently class, while low recall indicate that is more likely that a class is to be classified in other classes.
\\
\\
It will be interesting to see which of class was easier to predict than others. This can be seen by using confusion matrix. The confusion matrix consists a square matrix with one row for predicted class, and and column for actual class (or vice-versa).
An example of confusion matrix is shown on table \ref{tab:cmatrix}
	
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ll|l|l|l|}
			\cline{3-5}
			&  & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Actual} \\ \cline{3-5} 
			&  & $C_1$ & $C_2$ & $C_3$ \\ \hline
			\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\multirow{3}{*}{Predicted}} & $C_1$ & 8 & 0 & 0 \\ \cline{2-5} 
			\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{} & $C_2$ & 5 & 8 & 1 \\ \cline{2-5} 
			\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{} & $C_3$ & 5 & 3 & 8 \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}

\section{Existing work on terrain classification}
The terrain classification has been applied to both wheeled and legged robots. Wheeled robots have the benefit of achieving stable locomotion by changing their speed on different terrains, while the legged robots must either change their gait, walking speed or both. Changing the gait for a legged robot can be complex, but has the benefit of traverse on more difficult terrains. 
\\
\\
The most commonly used legged robot in terrain classification is using quadruped \cite{6784609,littleDog,6849778,Hoffmann20141790} and hexapod \cite{Walas2015,26b23e912c654fe4b7478fd910130195,6569179}, due to its stability on rough terrain. However a few has used one legged robot \cite{5602459}. Biped for terrain classification is still unsuitable since it is hard to maintain stability on rough terrain.
\\
\\
The bayes theorem suit to mathematical express the terrain identification problem, and allow to evaluate unexpected mismatch between sample classes and the real environments. In equation \ref{eq:bayesNaivews2}, the A could represent possible terrains that is expected to predict, while B is the data from sensor. According to the equation \ref{eq:bayesNaivews2} the $P(A \vert B)$ will be the likelihood that the terrain is this with these data from senor.

\subsection{Importance of terrain classification}
The importance of terrain classification for legged robots is that the terrain has a major factor affecting the decision for the gait change \cite{6569179}. Most of the legged robot has the benefit of changing their gait and walking speed to achieve a stable locomotion. For instance a running gait can be efficient on flat road, but fail to maintain the stability when used on ice, cause of slipping. An example of application is shown in Giguere et al. \cite{Giguere06environmentidentification}, where a amphibious legged robot can switch from walking to swimming gait, according to which of the terrain it is on. 
\\
\\
It has been shown that different controllers were suited for different terrain by letting quadrupedal robot hopping on soft and hard terrain \cite{7487541}. Other has investigated the effect of performance with different gaits parameters on different terrains \cite{6569179}. Some of the result showed that the energy consumption and the walking speed is tied to the terrain type. That is, a trade-off between the physical speed and the power consumption of the robot can be achieved by controlling the cycle-frequency of the leg rotation.
	
	
\subsection{Terrain sensing}
In order to classify various of terrains, the system must obtain information from the terrain either by remote sensing, local sensing or both.
	
\paragraph{Remote sensing}
The remote sensing obtain information of a terrain from a distance and do not measure the terrain physically. The camera is most widely used and discriminating the terrain is based on analyzing images.
\\
\\ 
Filitchkin et al. \cite{littleDog} presents an visual terrain classification by using a single, compact camera to change the gait patterns of a quadruped robot. Three types of gaits were used during the experiment, a gait designed for flat surface, a gait for rough terrain and a mixture of the two first. To know which gait should be chosen for each terrain, an initial test by assigning a gait to each terrain type is required. There were totally four different terrain: small rocks, rocks, grass and tile. Lastly, the experiment was let the robot execute a terrain classification cycle every few steps and switched to one of three gait according which terrain it is on. Robot performance was measured by comparing the traversal time between for each three gait and the changing gait. The result shown that the changing gait is able to terrain classification and traverse through the terrain faster. The other two gait were fast, but was not able to classify big rocks, while the last gait was able to classify all terrain but had slower traverse time.
\\
\\
Plagemann et al. \cite{4651026} used laser ranger finder to predict terrain elevation at unseen locations.
The researches extended the Gaussian process model to achieve a more accurate prediction of elevations. The result show that the proposed method is capable of accurately predicting elevations in the presence of noise even at unobserved locations. These features allowed them to plan foot trajectories of the robot to reach the goal location. 
\\
\\
A weakness of using the remote sensors, is that it does not give insight into the characteristic of currently terrain. For instance remote sensor might has difficulties to distinguish between a terrain that is covered with either compacted or uncompacted snow. An another option to measure terrain directly is by local sensing. 
	
\paragraph{Local sensing}
Local sensing measure aspects of the interaction between the robot and terrain as the robot walk through. This gives a measurement of mechanical terrain properties and provide useful information such as how the environment is affecting currently robot performance. 
\\
\\ 
Stejskal et al. \cite{7487544} present a road following hexapod robot by using the feedback from robot servo drives. The road following consists of let the robot blindly walk on road. After each gait cycle, the robot will determines whether it is on new terrain or on road. If it is determined as off road, then the robot will steer back to the road. Data from the servo provides information about the leg motion which were position error, current speed and torque. Three different terrains, asphalt, dirt and grass were used during the experiment. The robot was most confused by dirt, which had about 86\% of misclassified samples. The author states that the transition from asphalt to dirt was usually flat, which means that the leg motion of walking on flat dirt has a similar leg motion as walking on asphalt. Beside of that, the overall result of terrain classification had an accuracy of 96.2\%, which can be considered as feasible approach and data from leg motion keeps the robot on the road.
\\
\\
Kim et al. \cite{5602459} used the ground reaction force and torque sensors of an one-legged robot due to terrain classification. The goal of the research was to compare the performance between neural network and support vector machine. Four different terrains were used in the experiments which were flat, grass, sand, and gravel. The data were collected by walking through each terrain many times. Different features were extracted from the data, and partitioned into a training and test set. The result shown the support vector machine got an accuracy on 78.75\%, which performed slightly better than neural network on 78.6\%.
\\
\\
Hoepflinger et al. \cite{5509309} present a novel approach to terrain classification for legged robots by using properties from joint motor currents and force sensing resistor. The goal was to improve the guiding of foot placement and stability of legged robots in rough terrain. Usually experiments is done by having a robot walk through terrains. However in this experiment the author separated one of the legs robot and mounted to a sample holder of a testbed. The first experiment consist of distinguish four different shaped terrain: a convex and a concave cone, a convex hemispherical bulge, and a concave hemispherical indentation. The data were collected by the knee-joint oscillated slightly with an amplitude of approximately one degree on the terrain. In the second experiment was to distinguish between three different types surfaces such as abrasive paper and a low friction PTFE coating. Collecting of data were done by performing a scratching motion on the terrain. The result of terrain shape classification had a high success rate. Convex cone and concave cone had 100\% accuracy, while the concave hemisphere bulge 95\% and 80\% on for the convex hemispherical bulge. Regarding surface classification show that the algorithm performed slightly worse. A type of an abrasive paper had a accuracy of 53.3\%. Even a low accuracy the author state it is overall an satisfy result, since the average correct prediction of different types of abrasive paper was two of three, and prediction of teflon coated surface had an high accuracy 93.3\%.
\\
\\
Terrain classification with other type of local sensor research of can be found in \cite{Giguere2009,6386243,6569179,6569179,4399500}
	
\subsection{Learning algorithms}
There is a vast number of classifiers and various has been used within the terrain classification such as neural network \cite{6784609,5752869,4654717}, adaptive bayesian filtering \cite{5152327,6849778}, support vector machines \cite{5602459,4161556,4059113} and decision tree \cite{6849778}.
\\
\\
The no free lunch theorem described in section \ref{seq:nofree} can be seen in previous work has shown that SVM, KNN and naive bayes gave higher accuracy than the decision tree \cite{DBLP:conf/emcr/WeissFSZ07}, while in \cite{6849778} achieved a better performance on SVM, decision tree and naive bayes than KNN. It is therefore common to build several algorithms, and chose the best of them for the specified problem. 
\\
\\
Mostly study based their terrain classification on supervised learning. However, Giguere and Dudek \cite{Giguere2009} presented a new clustering method to terrain classification using unsupervised learning. This make a robot to be able automatically distinguish terrain without any human interaction or feedback. Another work of the same authors  \cite{5752869} made a tactile probe and demonstrated that it can be used in unsupervised learning.
	
\subsection{Features} \label{sub:relatedfeatures}
As mentioned in section \ref{features} finding good features is a crucial part of classification process. Earlier work has extracted features in combination of statistical features in the time domain with frequency domain features \cite{5152662} \cite{Giguere2009} \cite{5509309}. While others only use the frequency domain \cite{4543710} \cite{5979766}.
\\
\\
Giguere and Dudek \cite{5152662} extracted features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, fifth moment and sum of the variation over time in time domain. While in frequency domain where the sum of higher half of amplitude spectrum extracted.
\\
\\
Hoffmann el at. \cite{Hoffmann20141790} defined features in time domain such as, minimum, maximum, mean, kurtosis, skewness, median, standard deviation, approximation of the integral, amplitude of Hilbert transform. Other features was extracted in frequency domain such as frequency with highest amplitude and its magnitude, and similar to the second and third highest amplitude. 
\\
\\
KertÃ©sz \cite{7387710} computed median, maximum, skewness and root mean square from of the accelerometer angles in x, y and z-direction. Those features were also extracted in frequency domain for the z-direction. Features extracted from force sensors were interquartile range, maximum, skewness, RMS amplitude and the highest amplitude in frequency domain.
\\
\\
Best el at.\cite{26b23e912c654fe4b7478fd910130195} extracted five statistical features in domain such as minimum, maximum, mean median and standard deviation. However some of statistical features is also calculated in frequency domain with the energy additionally.
\\
\\
As it can be seen that many of the features is extracted by statistical features which is described in section \ref{sub:statical}. An example of extracting good features can be seen in \cite{5602459}. Using statistic with support vector machine gave an accuracy on 40\%, while principal component analysis gave an accuracy on 78.75\%. Note that the author only used variance, kurtosis and skewness as statistic features. 
	
\subsection{Validation}\label{subseq:validation}
A common method of validation is using the k-fold cross-validation \cite{DBLP:conf/itat/MrvaF15,6784609,6386243,Hoffmann20141790,6849778,7387710}. However the choice of selecting k vary. A common k value is to be set either two \cite{DBLP:conf/itat/MrvaF15,6784609}, 10 \cite{26b23e912c654fe4b7478fd910130195,6386243,Hoffmann20141790,6849778,7387710} or equal the length of feature vectors \cite{26b23e912c654fe4b7478fd910130195}.
\\
\\
Mrva et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/itat/MrvaF15} used 2-fold cross validation and achieved a overall accuracy 99.4\%, and states the possibility of obtaining 100\% with more folds. Best el at. \cite{26b23e912c654fe4b7478fd910130195} used 10-fold cross validation and achieved a high precision and recall for all five terrains, while leave-one-out-cross validation let the classifier being confused between grass and concrete terrains. 
\\
\\
As stated in \cite{7387710}, the k-fold gives a reasonable estimate of the performance, however, it does not tell how well it predict on unseen data. This is because the experiment always use same samples where it involve in either training or testing. The model might be less generalized, data are more likely referring to themselves and will have difficulty of predicting unseen data. Mostly authors is aware of the this and has rectified it by partitioned the samples to make the training and test set independent \cite{26b23e912c654fe4b7478fd910130195}. The learning process will only be used from a certain set, and test is from other set.
\\
\\
Not all studies evaluated their models by k-fold cross-validation, but either with new data to get a better estimation or real accuracy \cite{5509309,Walas2015,5752869}. A more simple method of validation is to partitioned randomly the data set with 70\% used for training, and the rest used for testing \cite{5752869}. The most realistic scenario is to base the evaluation by having a robot traversing through different terrains \cite{DBLP:conf/itat/MrvaF15}.


\chapter{Softwares and tools}
This chapter gives an introduction to different tools and libraries used throughout the thesis.


\section{Optical force sensor}
The sensor used in this thesis is OptoForce (3D force sensor) \cite{Optoforce}. A construction of the sensor is shown on the figure \ref{fig:OptoforceBuild}. 
\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Figure showing construction of the 3d optical force used in thesis \cite{OptoforceFig}}
	\label{fig:OptoforceBuild}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

The sensor consists of a light emitter (LED) and four sensing elements (photodiodes) which is wrapped within two layers; a reflective layer and a sensing surface. The four photodiodes obtain the force by measuring the infrared light reflected by the reflective layer. If a force is applied on the sensing surface, the amount of reflected light to each photodiodes will change accordingly. The forces in x- and y-direction is measured from the difference in amount of reflected light between the two opposing photodiodes for each direction, while the force in z-direction is the average of the four measurements. Figure \ref{fig:OptoforceAxis} showing each direction on the sensor. Optoforce sensor is a relative new sensor (2015), and the manufacturer claim the sensor can guarantee precise measurements even up to 200\% overload \cite{Optoforce2}. Several works where the sensor was used can be found in \cite{7803326,7759112,7849467}.

\section{Robot}
The robot used in this thesis is a Quadruped Robot developed at the University of Oslo, which is shown in figure \ref{fig:robot}. The legs are about 45 cm long and mounted with optical force sensors. Four different gait is made by evolutionary algorithm and is developed by Nygaard et al. \cite{7850167}. Two gaits is single-objective, while the other multi-objective. However, only one gait is used in this project. The reason is that the other gait had issues while walking on the soft mat. The robot either got stuck with slow gait, or fell with fast gait. The gait used is a balanced multi-objective gait which let the robot go straight forward.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\section{Terrain} \label{seq:terrain}
Four different terrains are used in the experiments: floor, carpet, soft mat, and hard mat shown in figure \ref{fig:terrains}. A reason for choosing these is to get a more challenging task for classifier to distinguish them, because of similar properties. The intuition is that if the algorithm manages to discriminate between floor and carpet, it should be to distinguish other terrains as well. Floor, carpet and hard mat has the most similar properties, and is also the most difficult to distinguish. They are all slippery, and has nearly equally hardness. Soft mat differ from the other with its softness and high friction. The experiments will be investigating whether the classifier can distinguish these terrains with minor differences.

\section{Robot operating system}
The robot used in all experiments operate on a Robot operating system (ROS) \cite{ROSintro}. ROS is an open source software framework and used to create robot applications. ROS consists of nodes that can be grouped into packages and be shared and distributed. A node is a process that perform computation. For instance a node could be controlling the robot, while the other one control prediction of terrain. This allow parallel execution of the data collection and class prediction in real time. Currently, the most compatible programming language are Python, C++, and Lisp.

\subsection{Messages and topics}
A message is a data structure which could be integer, floating point, arrays etc. Nodes can use the message to send out a message by publishing it a given topic \cite{ROSconcept}. The topic is used to identify the content of the message where a node has the possibility to subscribe to the appropriate topic. This can be seen as many-to-many one-way transport.

\subsection{Services}
When a many-to-many one-way communication is not appropriate, service and client provide a request and reply interaction \cite{ROSconcept}. A service can be either requesting or replying to the client. The client calls the service by sending the request message and awaiting the reply.


\subsection{Bag}
Rosbag is a package for recording and playing back ROS message data \cite{ROSconcept}. This has the benefit of storing sensor data which is necessary for developing and testing algorithms.


\subsection{ROS driver for the Optoforce sensor}  
A ROS driver for optical force sensor is from \cite{optoRos}. The node is able to read data from the sensor with 100Hz and will publish the data stream as floats to a topic. 


\section{Algorithms libraries}
Python provide lots of libraries which reduce developing time. The libraries are well-documented and have the freedom to customize each algorithm to use. In this project libraries such as scikit-learn, scipy and runstats will be used to test each of different classifiers described in section \ref{sub:classifier}.

\paragraph{Scikit-learn}
Scikit-learn \cite{scikit-learn} is an open source library that provide tools for data mining and data analysis. The library is dependent on numpy, scipy and matplotlib. All of classifiers, and preprocessing data tool are from this library. 

\paragraph{Runstats}
Runstats \cite{runstats} is used to compute statistics, such as max, mean, skew, variance and standard deviation where some of them is described in section \ref{sub:statical}.


\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}        %% ... or ??
This chapter intends to explain the various choices which has been made to create machine learning models.
	

	
\section{Choice of implementation language}
The robot operating on ROS which is compatible with C++, Python and Lisp. Thus, segmentation of data, which will be described later in section \ref{subseq:segmentation} is implemented in C++. The reason of implementing data segmentation in C++ is because it is fast which can deal to store and delete data stream better. However, C++ does not provide many learning libraries, thus the learning approach is implemented in Python. 
			
\section{Data from optical force sensor}
This section will first describe how the measurement from sensor gathered. Next, it will present how the data is segmented into sequences and used as the basis for creating feature vectors.
	
\subsection{Data collection}
Data was gathered by having the robot walking 10 steps on each terrain. The runs were recorded into rosbag, and makes it possible to re-simulate the runs. Five runs for each terrain, and in total 20 runs were recorded. This gives in total 200 steps on each terrain for one sensor, and 800 steps with all four sensors together.

\subsection{Analyzing data from sensor}\label{sec:analyzopto}
Analyzing the data is to find common characteristics, and be able to segment desired data. Sensor data arrives in a stream as shown in figure \ref{fig:gtmgraf}. The periodic sequences is for each step. A common characteristic for all terrain is when the foot is in the air, then x,y, z-direction will have minor change and is almost constant. This characteristic will be used to segment desired data described in next section \ref{subseq:segmentation}. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{Figures/Gulvet4Teppe2}
	\caption{Figure showing an example of data stream from a terrain}
	\label{fig:gtmgraf}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Data segmentation} \label{subseq:segmentation}
An appropriate method to segment data is by sliding window algorithm, however, difficulty to decide an acceptable size of the window, difficulty of determining whether the data is relevant from the window, and too big window size is not efficient. Thus, a custom algorithm to segment data was created. 
\\
\\
In the thesis, it is considered that the most informative data of terrain is from when the foot is on the ground. The custom algorithm will be storing the data sequences when the foot is on the ground, and stops when it is not on the ground. As mentioned in section \ref{ sec:analyzopto}, a characteristic for all terrain when a foot is in the air, is that the x, y, and z-direction to a sensor has minor change in their values within a short sequence. Two thresholds have to be sets; one for considered as minor change, one for considered minimum length of the minor change sequence. When a foot reach the ground, there will be a big change in each direction for the sensor, and start to store the data from sensor into an array until it is in the air again. Each step will be used as a sample in training and test set.

\section{Feature extraction}\label{sec:featuex}
As mentioned in section \ref{features}, a good classifier is dependent of good features. As mostly of previous work have been extracting features both in time domain and frequency domain, this thesis will also be extracting in both domains.
	

	
\subsection{Feature sets}\label{sec:featuresets}
Five different feature set will be created and used to learn and evaluate each of classifiers. The following paragraphs will be introducing each sets.

\paragraph{Feature set one - raw data} 
This feature set use all data from each step in x, y and z-direction. As the length vary, the feature vector is decimated in front and end of the sequence to achieve a fixed length, in this case 125.  Choices of the sequence length and method of decimating is described in next section \ref{subseq:FixLength}. The feature vector set will look like:
	

\begin{align}\label{eq:f1}
f_{set1} &= \left\{ x_1,\dotsc,x_{125}, \right.\nonumber\\
&\qquad \left. {} y_1, \dotsc,y_{125}, \right.\nonumber\\
&\qquad \left. {} z_1,\dotsc,z_{125} \right\}
\end{align}


The vector contain 125 features from each 3 directions, which is in total 375 features.
	

		
		
	
\paragraph{Feature set two - statistical features} 
This feature set extracts statistical features from the dataset. As mentioned in section \ref{sub:relatedfeatures}, much of early work has been extracting the features with statistical metrics. Thus, this thesis will be using similar features. Calculation of some statistical metrics are described in section \ref{sub:statical}. The features created in this set will be from each direction, x,y and z in time domain: 
	
	%This is using some of the features from this article \cite{Hoffmann20141790}. 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The maximum value of the dataset in time domain
		\item The minimum value of the dataset in time domain
		\item The mean of the dataset in time domain
		\item The variance of the data set in time domain
		\item Skew in time domain
		\item Kurtosis in time domain 
		\item Standard deviation in time domain
	\end{enumerate}
	
The feature set will be look like:
	
\begin{align}
	f_{set2} &= \left\{ x_{max},x_{min},x_{skew},x_{kuortosis},x_{std},x_{var},x_{mean}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {} y_{max},y_{min},y_{skew},y_{kuortosis},y_{std},y_{var},y_{mean}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {} z_{max},z_{min},z_{skew},z_{kuortosis},z_{std},z_{var},z_{mean} \right\}
\end{align}
The vector contains 7 features from each direction, which is in total 21 features. 
	
\paragraph{Feature set three - complete frequency spectrum} 
Previous work has shown that using frequency has given good results. In this feature set, the raw data from time domain is transformed into the frequency domain by fast Fourier transform. After transformation, a decimation is used to achieve a fixed length. Since the minimum of length in time domain is 125, and the fast Fourier transform is symmetric, the minimum length of entire spectrum will be 62.5, however in this approach will be decimating to a length of 61. Contrary to decimate in front and end of the sequence, it is considered that data at end of the sequence is less important than in front, hence, these features will be discarded.
	
\begin{align}\label{eq:f1}
f_{set3} &= \left\{ fx_1,\dotsc,fx_{61}, \right.\nonumber\\
&\qquad \left. {} fy_1, \dotsc,fy_{61}, \right.\nonumber\\
&\qquad \left. {} fz_1,\dotsc,fz_{61}\right\}
\end{align}

The vector contains 61 features from each direction, which is in total 183 features. 
	
\paragraph{Feature set four - statistical features} 
This feature set compute the statistical metrics similar to feature set two, but in frequency domain. Additionally the energy of the spectrum suggested in \cite{26b23e912c654fe4b7478fd910130195}, by calculating the sum of the squares of the amplitudes is also used.
	
\begin{enumerate}
		\item The maximum value of the dataset in frequency domain
		\item The minimum value of the dataset in frequency domain
		\item The mean of the dataset in frequency domain
		\item The variance of the data set in frequency domain
		\item Skew in frequency domain
		\item Kurtosis in frequency domain 
		\item Standard deviation in frequency domain
		\item Energy 
\end{enumerate}
The feature vector which will be fed into the classifier:
\begin{align}
	f_{set3} &= \left\{ fx_{max},fx_{min},fx_{skew},fx_{kuortosis},fx_{std},fx_{var},fx_{mean},fx_{E}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {} fy_{max},fy_{min},fy_{skew},fy_{kuortosis},fy_{std},fy_{var},fy_{mean}fy_{E}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {} fz_{max},fz_{min},fz_{skew},fz_{kuortosis},fz_{std},fz_{var},fz_{mean},fz_{E} \right\}
	\end{align}
The vector contains 8 features from each direction, which is in total 24 features. 
	
\paragraph{Feature set five - set two and four} 
Good features might come from different feature sets. This set will collect feature set two and four into one unified set:
	\begin{align}
	f_{set5} &= \left\{ x_{max},x_{min},x_{skew},x_{kuortosis},x_{std},x_{var},x_{mean}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {}   y_{max},y_{min},y_{skew},y_{kuortosis},y_{std},y_{var},y_{mean}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {}  z_{max},z_{min},z_{skew},z_{kuortosis},z_{std},z_{var},z_{mean}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {} fx_{max},fx_{min},fx_{skew},fx_{kuortosis},fx_{std},fx_{var},fx_{mean},fx_{E}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {} fy_{max},fy_{min},fy_{skew},fy_{kuortosis},fy_{std},fy_{var},fy_{mean}fy_{E}, \right.\nonumber\\
	&\qquad \left. {} fz_{max},fz_{min},fz_{skew},fz_{kuortosis},fz_{std},fz_{var},fz_{mean},fz_{E} \right\}
	\end{align}
	
The vector contains 15 features from each direction, which is in total 45 features. 
	
\subsection{Achieving a fixed length of the sequences} \label{subseq:FixLength}
In order to use raw data as input, a fixed length is required. After many runs the length of data sequence vary between 125-135. Thus, the steps will be decimated to a constant length of 125. A simplified method for achieving fixed length is listed in \ref{code1}. Note the technique is simplified to one-dimensional array, while in thesis has 3-dimensional array, but the intention is same. Contrary to discard the data either in front or end of the sequence, this technique will be discarding on both sides, to retain the data in middle, which is considered as more informative data.

\section{Learning approach}
The procedure of learning approach is divided into two processes: collecting data samples into files and the learning process.
	
\subsection{Collecting samples}
The first process is to gather data for each terrain and will be stored into files. Those files will be collected into a single file, and used as training and test samples in the next process. The procedure is shown in figure \ref{fig:createsamples}.

\end{enumerate}
\clearpage

\subsection{Learning process} \label{subsec:learningProc}
When the data samples of each terrain is unified into a single file, the learning process is shown in figure \ref{fig:learningProcess}, is to evaluate each classifier. Rectangles are a processes that takes an given input and produces an output. The dashed rectangles are processes that can be skipped.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Evaluate the accuracy performance of each five classifiers. Additionally, investigate whether a feature scaling is suitable.  
	\item The learning process will integrating two different feature selection methods which might increase the performance. 
	\item Some of the top performer will be further tested on new test samples.
	\item Evaluate the performance when the robot walks through two different terrains.
	\item Using the training sample to predict other sensor. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analysis}
The result shown that all classifiers have an accuracy of at least 70\%. The Decision tree and Neural Network has the highest accuracy with 96\% from scaled feature set one. 
\\
\\
Regarding the feature scaling, SVM is the one with huge effect. The KNN which also using distances is also affected by scaling, but most of them gave lesser accuracy. While Neural Network, Decision tree and Bayes Navies do not rely on distance between features, only Bayes Navies was not affected. The Neural Network and Decision Tree had minor effect on the performance. Since the feature scaling had great affect on the SVM and minor on the other classifier, scaled features will be used in further experiments.
\\
\\
Among the highest result is either from whole raw data sequence or complete frequency domain. These type of features has the benefit of ensuring that all the information is in the data. However, too many features has a risk learning from noises, and lead to overfitting as mentioned in section \ref{curseDim}.
\\
\\
Figure \ref{fig:meanxyz} shows the mean of 10 samples in x,y and z-direction in the time domain. As seen on figures \ref{fig:meanx} and \ref{fig:meanz}, floor and soft mat are the terrains which differ the most and should be easy to predict. Even shapes of curves to the floor is similar the carpet, the force in x- and z-direction is higher for the floor. While carpet and hard mat differ from its shapes of curve, but has the most similar values, which might be the most difficulty to discriminate. 
\\

A mean of 10 samples in frequency domain is shown in figure \ref{fig:fftxyz}. The floor differ from the other in z-direction as seen in figure \ref{fig:fftz}, while the soft mat differ the most in x-direction shown in figure \ref{fig:fftx}. Again, carpet and hard mat has similar values.

\section{Further improving all classifier}
Even there are classifier which outperform the other, there are still improvement potential. In the previous approach, the feature selection was not taken in account. The purpose of not using the feature selection was to see the performance without losing any features. In following experiment, the feature selection will be integrated on previous implementation to see if there any improvement. The modified implementation is shown in figure \ref{fig:approach2}, where the added component is marked as red. The filter and wrapper method will be used. Both is library provided by scikit. The filter method will be removing features with low variance, while the wrapper method is recursive feature elimination.

\section{Analysis}
From table \ref{tab:exp2} one can see that the filter selection has made most of the classifier more inaccurate. Only neural network and decision tree with feature set one which has shown some improvement. This may indicate that important features were removed. The wrapper selection, on the other hand, also have some classifier which performed less accurately, but the difference between old result is less than filter. Some of classifier has improved significant, particularly the SVM with feature set three with 97\% accuracy.
\\
\\
Note that the k-fold validation test using always use the same single set both for training and testing, which make it referring to themselves has the risk of not generalizing the classifier. In this case results from \ref{tab:exp2} only gives an estimation on how well a classifier is, but does not tell how well it predict on unseen data. One way to avoid this issue is make the training and testing set independent to each other, so the prediction will be based on new and unseen data \cite{26b23e912c654fe4b7478fd910130195}. The following experiment will be using two highest performed classifier shown in \ref{tab:exp2}. As there are three shared second best classifier, all of them will be in further experiments. Additionally, KNN using wrapper method with feature set five achieved a satisfied result which will also be further investigated. The reason is among the four best performed classifier is only using either the entire raw data or frequency domain. Thus, it will be interesting to compare a classifier with extracted features.

\section{Cross validation with unseen data} \label{seq:crossunseen}
In this experiment 50 new samples for each terrain is collected. In the cross validation it will use the old dataset as training set, while the new collected samples will be used as test file. The cross validation is still LOOCV. The training and test set will be randomly shuffled before the cross validation. Thus, to achieve more precise measurement, each test will be running five times.

	On the table \ref{svmexp} showing accuracy. The average is at least 94\%, and has the average 95.2\%. It can be seen that classifier simple distinguish floor and soft mat, while the carpet has a little confusion, and the hard mat is more confused. As seen in table \ref{fscoresvm} the soft mat has a f-score on 100\%, which means high precision and recall. Floor is second highest f-score with average 96\%. The recall is the reason of decreased f-score. The hard mat and carpet has relative equally f-score. However the carpet got a lower recall, but higher precision, while the hard mat got higher recall, but lower precision.

	On the table \ref{nn2} showing accuracy. Compared to the old result from \ref{tab:exp2} with accuracy on 96\%, the classifier perform more poorly on unseen data, with average accuracy 67.4\%. The classifier has most difficulty of distinguish the hard mat, but do have some problems with floor too. The soft mat is the easiest terrain to predict with f-score on 100\%, shown in \ref{nnfscore}. Carpet is second highest f-score with average... Even the precision is high, but the recall is low. Third highest f-score is floor. Recall and precision is factor which lead to low f-score. The least highest f-score is the hard mat with average... The recall is relative high, but the precision is low, which make a low f-score.

\subsubsection{Decision Tree - Feature set one}
On the table \ref{dt1e} showing accuracy. Comparing to the old result from \ref{tab:exp2}, the classifier perform more poorly on unseen data. Again, the soft mat is the easiest terrain to recognize, and has the highest f-score. There is confusion when it is on hard mat. It is confused by hard mat and carpet. However, when there is less confusion when the robot is on carpet. When it is on hard mat, the classifier tend to predict carpet than hard mat. That is what make carpet have a hight precision, but low recall. However, the hard mat has a higher recall, but lower precision.

	\subsection{KNN - Wrapper - Feature set five}
	Comparing the new result from table \ref{dt4} to the old result from table \ref{tab:exp2}, the accuracy has decreased a little. It is shown that the it is confused especially between the hard mat and carpet. When it is on the hard mat it rather predict as carpet. However, there is less confusion when the robot is on carpet and is more able to predict correct.
	
	
\subsection{Summary}
Five different classifier with different feature sets were investigated. Compared to the old result from table \ref{tab:exp2}, every classifier has decreased their accuracy. SVM still have the highest accuracy, even on predicting unseen data. KNN on other hand, which were least highest among those five tested classifiers were the second best on predicting unseen data. Neural network is the classifier with least accuracy. The decision tree with and without feature selection has relative equal accuracy.
\\
\\
It can be seen a common confusion for each classifiers when the robot is on hard mat. Mostly of classifiers tend to chose carpet instead of hard mat. This is also the reason that the f-score of carpet and hard mat is relative low, even there are high precision on predicting carpet on carpet. The least confusion is the soft mat, where the every classifier has a average over 90\%. The floor also achieved a high f-score, except for the neural network without filter. The neural network had issues to distinguish between floor and carpet. 
	

	
\section{Classification in real-time} \label{sec:realtime}
To get a more realistic practical scenario  is based on evaluation of the classification, where the robot traversing in different terrains. For this experiment, the robot will be walking on two different terrains. There are total five different setup. The uequal length of each steps is that the robot tend to walk out off current terrain, thus stops the experiments. 
	
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Floor to carpet
		\item Hard mat to floor
		\item Hard mat to soft mat
		\item Soft mat to hard mat
		\item Soft mat to carpet
	\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection{Real time implementation}
The real time implementation can be seen on figure \ref{fig:realtime}, which is a small modification of earlier approach. In this implementation will be creating a server node after model a classifier. The training is same set with 50 samples for each terrain. The server will be waiting for a request from another node, which is in this case segment data. The segment data gather data stream from the optoforce sensor. The method to collecting interesting data is described in \ref{subseq:segmentation}. After a step is extracted from sensor, it will then be passed to the server. The server will receive the data and start to preprocess the data. It will extracted features, select features and scale accordingly to the training samples. The last step will be to predict the feature vector. The result is what terrain it is on. However, in this case the Python provide a probability function on SVM, which is used. In the documentation the probability might give wrong probability on very small data set. However, the data set is considered as not very small data set, and it is interesting to look at probability when it predict. After given a result, it will be waiting for new partitioned from segment data. Even many of the methods is same as early, however a detail of this process is to clarify the implementation.

\subsection{Floor to carpet}
The data stream is shown in figure \ref{fig:gulvet4teppegraf} and the table \ref{tab:Gulvet4teppe} show probability of the terrains for each step. In this experiment the robot walked four step on floor and the rest on carpet. The accuracy of predicting correct is 88.9\%. However, looking how certain the classifier to predict correct is lower. Fifth step is the transition and as it can be seen it is confused. It is worth noticing that at fourth step the carpet has almost same probability as the floor. The soft mat and hard mat has small probability and is more likely not to be predicted.

The data stream is shown in figure \ref{fig:softcarpet} and the table \ref{tab:softcarpet} show probability of the terrains for each step. It has predicted 7 of 8 correctly. As seen in the figure \ref{fig:softcarpet}, there is a large variation from walking soft mat to carpet. On small soft mat the amplitude is significant smaller than carpet. At the fifth step is when the robot walked from the old terrain to the new one, and the probability of carpet is approximately 66.7\%. However the second highest has a probability of 21.6\%, which it clear what terrain it is. Regarding sixth step, the classifier has a wrong prediction between carpet and hard mat. There is a high probability of hard hard mat. A few factors which might cause that, is looking to the figure \ref{fig:softcarpet}. The shape y direction differ from the other after it, and so is for the amplitude.

\subsection{Summary}
In this experiment five different transition between two terrains. A common characteristic is that the probability decrease particular on the transition step. It predict correct when the terrain has a huge difference to the other such as soft mat. While transition between more similar terrain has a wrong prediction at the transition. The first step has tend to either have relative high probability approximately 90\% or low probability approximately 54\%.
	
	
\section{Prediction on other sensor}
The classification has been based on only one sensor on front left foot, thus it will be interesting to see whether it is possible to use the currently training set to classify accurately on front right foot. If it achieve a high accuracy might indicate that one the both feet on the front can be using the same training set instead of separately which is more convenient.

\chapter{Discussion}
	
\section{Five classifier prediction on unseen data}
It is shown that the many classifiers has decreased performance when it come to predicting unseen data. As seen in section \ref{seq:crossunseen}, the neural network and decision tree does not show adequate performance. A reason could be that the classifier is overfitted and not able to generalize the data. Note that those classifiers of raw data sequences, and the method of achieving fixed length by decimate data described in section \ref{subseq:FixLength} might been affecting the performance. In this approach it is considered that data at start and the end of sequence is less important. However, the longer the sequence is, the more data must be removed from the feature vector and has a risk of removing important features. Another weakness of using raw data is the risk of learning with noises. Learning with noises might cause of not generalization the model and achieve a poor performance. However, noises are inherent in real world measurement, thus by discarding the noises might also give a poor result. Note each classifier use their default values which also affect the performance, especially neural network. The neural network is a complex classifier with many parameter that need to be adjusted such as size of hidden layers. Amount of hidden layers and hidden nodes provide significant improvement in their performance.  
\\
\\
Regarding a common confusion on hard mat, for each of classifier tend to predict it as carpet, while the soft mat has a high probability. As seen on previous chapter \ref{ch:implementation} in figures \ref{fig:meanxyz} and \ref{fig:fftxyz}, the hard mat and carpet has the most similar characteristic and is most likely to be confused.
\\
\\
Regarding SVM, the results has not been change during each run. That indicate that the good features is kept and able to distinguish between each terrain. However, there is still a small confusion between floor, carpet and hard mat. 
	
	
\section{Transition between terrains}
The result achieved in transition between terrains, done in section \ref{sec:realtime}, indicates that the classifier is able to identify terrains even with minor differences in their properties. By adding each step and divide by total, the overall accuracy is  86.8\%. Misclassification is mostly cause of transition between hard mat to floor, seen in table \ref{sec:hmssm}. After traversing from hard mat to carpet, the classifier tend to predict floor. Looking on estimation of unseen data in table \ref{svmexp}, show a that the carpet tend to have small misclassification to floor. But, as mentioned in section \ref{sec:realtime}, the robot tend to not walking straight, which might cause misclassification. All of the training samples has been gathered when the robot walked straight. Thus, since the sensor is highly sensitive it might be affected when it walks toward right or left.
\\
\\
Having training samples where the robot traversing straight through each of one terrain have shown some significant appreciable in their performance. Observations on steps before crossing to new terrain has a less probability of predicting correct. A feasible method to prevent this, is to have training samples where it traverse through different terrains. However, misclassifying terrain when it cross should not be important when it is able to identify terrains after few step.    
\\
\\
Is also seen that in the beginning the probability of correct terrain is also typically low. It might indicate that the first step has a particular behavior, as the in the middle the robot got more stable, thus more training data on the first step to achieved higher probability on first step. It is shown that the sensor is capable to distinguish minor differently terrain, even the probability is low. Soft mat has a low start.
	
\subsection{Predicting on the other sensor}
It can be seen that the classifier had difficulty of predicting hard mat. As seen in the figures, the data provided from the right front foot differ some from the left front foot. However, there are characteristics such as shape and curve of the graphs. Note, the when mounting sensor on the foot there is a possibility of the sensor does not point on same directions. However, it mostly of the terrains have been predicted correct. The hard mat has been a common problem of the classifier. Beside of that, it is shown a possibility using the training data from the LF on RF.
	
\subsection{Compared to earlier work}
Looking of early similar approaches on table \ref{table:compareEarly}, the thesis approach has achieved reliable result by using the optical force sensor....

\section{Conclusion}
The aim of this thesis was to investigate the possibility of terrain classification using a 3D optical force sensor. The approach was machine learning on force data provided from the sensor mounted on a quadruped robot. Four different terrains were used during the experiments, floor, carpet, hard mat, soft mat. 
\\
\\
The evaluation of force sensor, were by using five different classifiers, bayes Naives, decision tree, KNN, neural network and SVM. The feature scaling had positive impact on SVM while small on the other, which should be included in this approach.
\\
\\
Beside of using evaluate on five different classifiers, five different feature sets were used. The feature sets consists of either using whole raw data in time domain or frequency domain, statistical metrics in time domain, frequency domain or both.
\\
\\
The best performance were a combination of the classifier, SVM, and the feature set, using the whole frequency.  
\\
\\
Many of the classifiers had a high accuracy during the cross validation. However by picking up five good performed classifier to see the performance on unseen data. As anticipated, the accuracy dropped most of them. The neural network and decision tree which had an accuracy over 90\%, dropped to 64\% and 78\%, respectively. The best performed classifier were SVM with an accuracy over 90\%, but had difficulty of predicting the terrain, hard mat.
\\
\\
A real time implementation was implemented due to more realistic scenario when the robot walking through different terrains. 
\\
\\
The last experiment was using training data from sensor mounted on left front to predict right front samples. It is shown the graph might differ from the other, but has the same characteristics. It can be seen there is a possibility of using same trainings data from both sensor. 
\\
\\
The results in this work has shown an impressive performance compared to earlier similar work. 

	
\subsection{Future work}
Every classifier has parameters that can be optimized. Using default values is more unlikely that this is suitable for terrain classification. Although, in the first two experiment has shown a reliable performance of classifiers, however it becomes unreliable when it comes to predicting unseen data. It could be that more training samples is needed. However, choosing a correct set of hyper parameters might increase its performance. Thus, having hyperparameter optimization could be further research, to see if there are other classifiers achieve a better performance than currently SVM.
\\
\\
The classifier is based on the features from contact force. However, features of terrain itself such as hardness and friction are not analyzed directly. It might be hidden inside the classifier and could be addressed in future work. 
\\
\\
The terrains in this thesis has only been experimented with flat terrain. It will be interesting to include more rough surface or other type. By adding more terrains it will also be interesting to fusion more sensor to achieve a higher reliability. Other type of sensor could be used such as body motion of the robot might provide more information of the terrain.  
\\
\\
The main focus has been using one of the sensor to evaluate the quality of data. There has been a little experiment using one of the training sets to predict other sensor. It has show good results. However having all four sensors together to predict terrain could be addressed as further work. Incorporate all four legs.
